# Installing-and-Utilization-of-pfSense-Firewall 🛡️🚫

<h2>📚 Introduction</h2>
Welcome back, for this project I will delve into the implementation and utilization of pfSense firewall 🧱. This is an open-source firewall that acts as a protective barrier between your internal network and the internet, allowing you to control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic. It is also user-friendly which makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced users.

<h2>🛠️ Tools That I Used</h2>

- <b>[VirtualBox🔄-(Download the version for your operating system)](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)</b>: This is an open-source virtualization platform that allows us to create and manage virtual machines (VMs). For our cybersecurity home lab, I would be using it to simulate diverse operating systems and network configurations within isolated environments.
- <b>[pfSense Firewall 🧱-(Download the AMD 64-bit version)](https://pfsense.org/download/)</b>: With this, I can implement firewall rules, manage network address translation (NAT), set up virtual private networks (VPNs), and perform other security-related tasks.

<h2>🔄💻 Required System Requirement: I use an HP ENVY x360 Laptop (Not the best but it does the job)</h2>

- <b>[🧠 CPU: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1355U 1.70 GHz (Anything higher than this will work)]</b>
- <b>[💾 RAM: 16GB (gigabytes) of RAM (I will say 8 GB of RAM or higher will suffice)]</b>
- <b>[📀 Disk: 1TB (Terabyte) (500GB - 1000GB of free disk space will be enough)]</b>
- <b>[🔄 BIOS/UEFI: VT-x, AMD-V, or the equivalent must be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI]</b>
- <b>[🔧 System Type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor (⚠️MANDATORY: This is a must)]</b>

<h2>📝 Step by Step Guide To Setting Up pfSense Firewall

- <b>[THIS LINK IS A WELL-DETAILED GUIDE OF THE PROJECT](https://www.youtube.com/live/GUCRDqplwMQ?si=YrEbBZ45ju9DIfwx)</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 1: Download and install VirtualBox from the official website. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 2: Download and exact all the other tools (Kali Linux, Windows server 2019, Windows 11 OS, and Metasploitable). Lastly, you can also put everything in a designated folder to make it look organized.</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 3: We are going to create a VM for each tool. > Open VirtualBox and click on "New" to create a new virtual machine for each tool. Repeat the process for each tool. You can check out the video I linked above for a more detailed process</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 4: Connect VMs in a Network > In VirtualBox, select each VM and go to "Settings" > "Network." Choose the "Bridged Adapter" for each VM to connect them to the same network.</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 5: We explore and practice: As I said we are only setting up the Home lab and connecting each tool, then using it for future projects. So keep watch for the next project]
